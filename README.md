ðŸŒŒ Youâ€™re Here â€” A 3D mood-focused memory map built on spiral time and particle emotion

I am building Youâ€™re Here as a personal experiment; part cosmic mood tracker, part spatial diary. Itâ€™s a 3D spiral that floats through space, where each loop represents a year and each dot or dust trail marks a memory. Mood becomes motion, time becomes shape.

The idea came from a reflection prompt in Feeling Good by David D. Burns, where you try to re-inhabit the emotional tone of a past moment. You usually canâ€™t. That gap between then and now, between the version of you that felt something and the version remembering it is where this map lives.

I overengineered the particle logic and visual events. The animations have multiple layers and mechanics that shift depending on intensity:

- You can place single-day bursts or long emotional seasons. You can name the feeling, set the intensity, and decide whether time was crisp or fuzzy.
- Events are mapped onto a 3D spiral by date, with radial growth and vertical descent over time creating a sense of motion through memory.
- Each event renders with three particle layers to create a nebula-like depth effect: a dense core (primary), ambient glow (secondary), and soft filler (tertiary)
- Higher intensity increases particle count, spread radius, animation speed, and opacity, making strong emotions feel more vivid and alive.
- Shorter events look brighter and more concentrated; longer events stretch across the spiral and appear softer and more diffuse; same intensity, different impact.
- Particles gently breathe and drift, with slight randomness in speed and movement to keep the scene feeling organic and emotionally responsive.

No GitHub link for this (yet) but you can read on the design process and choices and core logic, see initial hand drawing, gifs, photos and more videos on the attached Medium link.

Youâ€™re not stuck. Youâ€™re here.
